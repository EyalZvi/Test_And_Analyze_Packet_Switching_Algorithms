# Test And Analyze Packet Switching Algorithms

**With the ongoing increase of users online, one of the major factors of network efficiency is congestion control**.

Many service providers try to solve this problem by using load balancing algorithms when the main goal is to minimize service time and reduce congestion in each server individually

In this Mininet project we will simulate and compare different scheduling algorithms in order to determine which of the algorithms tested is optimal for each scenario.

# Test Cases:

**Topology 1**: 3 Clients vs. 3 Servers - All servers with equal service times
